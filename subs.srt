1
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,650
Lucien: You will encounter your luckiest day of the year this month.

2
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:35,500
Lucien: .....When you feel that a certain action needs extra good luck and support, please heed the voice of your heart and enjoy the energy of the universe.

3
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,583
Withdrawing his gaze from the phone screen, Lucien looks toward me with a smile.

4
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:45,883
Lucien: Looks like our answers are the same.

5
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:49,650
MC: …Really? So magical!¹

6
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,000
I delightfully hold my phone and move closer. The two connected screens clearly display the same deck of cards with the same guiding words.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,800
Lately, several colleagues at the company have been keen on looking into metaphysics, so I pulled Lucien along to have some fun after dinner today.

8
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,916
Even though I know I should regard public fortune-telling with rationality, the "mutual understanding" born out of random probability still brings a sweet delight to my heart.

9
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,666
I shift into a more comfortable position and nestle up to his side, even shaking my head in satisfaction.

10
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:12,033
Lucien: Does this make you so happy?

11
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:16,083
MC: Because it's a coincidence, it's very easy for this kind of just-right sense of destiny to hit you right in the heart~

12
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:24,783
Lucien: Then I'd rather understand it this way. It's because we're becoming more and more alike now that we've made the same choice.

13
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:31,516
Lucien: Rather than fate's arrangement, I'd rather attribute it to you.

14
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:37,683
MC: Professor Xu's 'theory' indeed sounds more reasonable, I especially resonate with it~

15
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:42,116
I smile as I rest my head against his shoulder, my fingertip unconsciously tapping at the screen.

16
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:49,033
MC: But no matter how I look at it, this set of cards is just too perfect. It kinda feels like I've already been hit by good luck, and that just makes me look forward to it even more.

17
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:53,416
Lucien lets out a thoughtful 'mm', but it doesn’t feel like a response. I turn my head in puzzlement, seeing him looking back at the text on the screen as if he's scrutinizing it.

18
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:57,033
I just made a casual remark, this person wouldn't actually be seriously studying it now, would he?

19
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,633
MC: Lucien, I...

20
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,583
A sudden kiss completely devours the words I haven't yet spoken.

21
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:07,883
His broad palm cradles the back of my head, pulling my lost balance back into his arms.

22
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:12,800
Our pressed skin stirs up a faint, restless heat, and his unbroken kisses surge like the tide, leaving me only fleeting moments to catch my breath.

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,083
It isn't until it suddenly starts raining outside, its soft patter mixing with the hum of the air conditioner, that he finally puts some distance between us.

24
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:21,616
Rainwater covers the condensation on the windows once again, a scene that seems to repeat countless times throughout this rainy season.

25
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:28,433
As if he notices that I am about to 'call him out'², Lucien innocently blinks his eyes and taps on the screen with righteous confidence, bringing up the previous page—

26
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:32,100
"Don't be stingy in expressing your love to your partner."

27
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:39,000
Lucien: I just wanted to experience the feeling of being struck by good luck too.

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,316
MC: Pfft, now you're the one getting superstitious.

29
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:50,250
Lucien: After all, I also have things I want to look forward to.

30
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,050
As we chat, the phone screen dims, and only the heart-shaped lamp on the bookshelf remains lit, blending the two of us curled up on the sofa into its dreamy, romantic glow.
//Trivia, The heart-shaped lamp is their gift from 7th anniversary!//

31
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:03,733
As the rain beats noisily, I suddenly feel like teasing him and brush my foot lightly against his.

32
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:10,016
MC: But Professor Xu, we're facing a real-world problem right now.

33
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:15,183
MC: According to the card reading, to enjoy the energy of the universe, we need to experience nature and soak up plenty of sunshine.

34
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:20,283
MC: But the weather forecast says it’ll be rainy in Loveland City for the next few weeks, so what can we do?

35
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:25,683
Lucien: Maybe we could make a few teru teru bozu³ and hang them up?

36
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:30,466
When he finishes speaking, he starts laughing first, which makes me laugh too as I cup his face in my hands and gently knead it.

37
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:37,050
MC: It’s over. All the rationality and logic of my great scientist have slipped away. That won't do, I've got to catch them and bring them back.

38
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,050
Lucien: Just let them go.

39
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,516
Lucien takes the opportunity to hold my hand and pulls me down onto the sofa, wrapping me fully in his embrace.

40
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:51,950
Lucien: Right now, all I want is to have a sweet dream with you.

41
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,816
As he speaks, he tightens his arms around me, making me nestle my head even more snugly against his chest.

42
00:04:56,816 --> 00:05:01,666
In my haze, I hear Lucien speak.

43
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:07,266
Lucien: MC, your anticipation won’t be in vain.

44
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:18,566
Lucien: Though I don't know what exactly will happen then, I believe the entire universe will come to help you.

45
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:30,666
Lucien: And when that time comes, do remember to give me good luck and support too.

46
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:40,650
[¹] 神奇 (shén qí) is the key term of this story; it is a two-character compound word made up of two words: 神 (shén - literally "god" or "divine”) and 奇 (qí- literally "strange," "rare," "unusual”). It refers not just to unexpected phenomena, but to events and maybe even presence that feel uncannily perfect, fated, or deeply moving, almost as if the universe has ✨aligned✨ just for you.

47
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,466
In this translation, I will translate 神奇 as words like magical, wondrous, or miraculous, depending on the context, so if you see those words please remember its thematic significance!

48
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:54,916
[²] The idiom used for that description is 兴师问罪 (xīng shī wèn zuì), which literally means "to mobilize troops to question a crime." 兴师 refers to raising an army, while 问罪 means to hold someone accountable for wrongdoing. 

49
00:05:54,916 --> 00:06:01,500
Compared to just accusing sb, it's more dramatic and has that sense of righteous authority LOL. Here, it's used playfully as she’s about to pretend to make a big deal and confront Lucien for kissing her without warning~

50
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,350
[³] "Teru teru bozu" (てるてる坊主) or known in Chinese as 晴天娃娃 (qíng tiān wá wa-literally means clear sky/sunny day doll) is a small handmade doll crafted from white cloth or paper and hung by windows to pray for sunny skies. 

51
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:18,100
For someone like Lucien, who typically relies on data and logic, his willingness to hang some not only shows the care he puts into preparing even the smallest details beyond his rationality for her happiness, but also reveals a growing, softer side of him that's learning to embrace wonder and hope no matter how irrational it may seem 🥺

52
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,983
Before we get to Exclusive Radio, it’s important to know that person he is speaking to in Because of Love Exclusive Radio is the same Zeng Shu (曾抒) from last year's summer 海不再遥远 SP (The Sea No Longer Far Away/Seaside at Last SP) Exclusive Radio (You can check the link of the date in Pre-Kite SP Guide!)

53
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:33,666
Though in the official localization, there was a mistranslation where Lucien asks him, "Aren't you a recent graduate?", whereas in the original, Xu Mo actually said that Professor Zeng isn't a recent graduate, which is why he was confused about why such a senior professor with extensive experience would suddenly want to withdraw from the project.

54
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:41,050
As for now, from the CN Server 2024 100 Days Countdown Event, Xu Mo's diary revealed that he eventually returned to the project. Anyway, since the official localization refers to him as Joshua, I’ll stick with that naming convention. Similar to how I translate Xu Mo as Lucien Xu in my own translation, I’ll translate his name into Joshua Zeng.

55
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:47,433
[Lucien] Professor Zeng? Is something the matter?

56
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,366
[Joshua] My apologies for disturbing your rest.

57
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:53,400
[Joshua] I called because I have some good news to share with you.

58
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:00,783
[Joshua] First, the project I've been working on made a major breakthrough today. I believe the following steps will go much more smoothly.

59
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:04,150
[Lucien] That's great. Everyone must be really happy, right?

60
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,216
[Joshua] Yes, we were even afraid it might be a false reading, so we specifically ran multiple rounds of cross-verification.

61
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:12,516
[Joshua] We've been running calculations since midnight, and it’s only now that we’re certain that there's no issue.

62
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:20,700
[Joshua] Looking back now, I realize it really has been a long time since this project was first launched…

63
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,283
[Lucien] Mm, this is the project you brought into my lab.

64
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:27,600
[Lucien] Just counting the time at the Bioscience Research Center, it's been about three years.

65
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,350
[Lucien] If we factor in the time you spent doing independent research beforehand, it's roughly been… about seven years?

66
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,150
[Joshua] Seven years and eight months.⁴

67
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,483
[Joshua] There was a time I thought I might have to wait a few more years before I could see any progress in the experiment.

68
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:43,350
[Joshua] It seems I'm still quite lucky after all.

69
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,416
[Lucien] Congratulations to you.

70
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:51,566
[Joshua] Thank you for your congratulations. After all, maybe in a few more years, we’ll be able to publish papers under the name of the Bioscience Research Institute!

71
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,516
[Joshua] In any case, let's organize the data again.

72
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:59,183
[Joshua] When you come to the research center next week, we will discuss the specifics in more detail.

73
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:05,816
[Lucien] Alright. If there's no rush over the next few days, let the researchers in the team take some appropriate time off as well.⁵

74
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,900
[Lucien] Everyone has been working hard lately.

75
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:14,550
[Joshua] Will do. I noticed that while we were waiting for the data just now, a few of the young folks were already planning to go see the sea.

76
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,133
[Lucien] Then I'll be waiting to approve everyone’s leave applications.

77
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:22,300
[Lucien] But you said "some" good news just now. Is there any other good news?

78
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,050
[Joshua] So here's the thing. Didn't you submit two papers?

79
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,250
[Joshua] I got the news today that both papers were accepted.

80
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,316
[Lucien] Hm? I thought the reviewers would raise a few more rounds of feedback.

81
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:40,750
[Joshua] Yes. So as soon as the news came in today, Xiao Luo was overjoyed; he even asked if I wanted to go with him to fulfill his vow.⁶

82
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,816
[Joshua] I don't have the energy to run around with him, and I'm not much of a believer in that sort of thing…

83
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:49,066
[Joshua] Still, today really is worthy of being called a 'lucky day.'

84
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,166
[Lucien] Lucky day…

85
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,850
[Joshua] What did you say just now?

86
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,683
[Lucien] Ah, it's nothing.

87
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:59,450
[Lucien] It's just that I think people occasionally do need a little bit of good luck.

88
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:07,183
[Joshua] After all, most of the time, aren't our preparations and efforts precisely about waiting for that tiny bit of luck to come knocking?

89
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:11,033
[Lucien] Then it seems today is the day luck comes knocking.

90
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,483
[Joshua] Sure is!

91
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:17,166
[Joshua] Oh, and also, we're planning to have dinner together next Wednesday to celebrate.

92
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,766
[Joshua] If you have time, feel free to bring your significant other with you.⁷

93
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:24,250
[Lucien] Alright, I'll ask her about it later.

94
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,450
[Joshua] Then I won't bother you any further.

95
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,516
[Joshua] Wish you a pleasant weekend. Goodbye.

96
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:48,283
[⁴] By July 2025, when the Kite SP card was released on the CN server, “seven years and eight months” is exactly how long the game has been out since the server’s initial launch, so it also marks seven years and eight months since we first met Lucien according to the in-game timeline,

97
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:59,816
This little detail makes it feel as if this date had been planned from the very beginning ;-; or at the very least, it's a touching callback to the long road we've shared and how we've finally arrived at this point together🥲 Just as he said in the card’s line: "When we arrived, we walked a long way to get here, so there's still a long way to go." It’s been a long road, and there’s still a long way ahead~

98
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:07,550
[⁵] Aww, I love it when growth from earlier stories carries over and shows up in later ones. Look at this guy’s development compared to 海不再遥远 SP (The Sea No Longer Far Away/Seaside at Last SP). 

99
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:26,633
He went from someone who didn’t understand the value of rest (for himself or others), to someone who not only understands it now but even suggests it for his team🥺

100
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:37,666
[⁶] If you ask a god for help or make a wish to them, you're expected to return to that god's temple or statue to express your thanks once the wish comes true. This act is called 还愿 (huán yuàn), which means fulfilling a vow or repaying a spiritual promise.

101
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:46,450
[⁷] While 家属 (jiā shǔ) literally means family member, it's different from 家人 (jiā rén) as 家属 (jiā shǔ) often implies a legal or formally recognized familial relationship, someone legally acknowledged as part of their household, such as a spouse or dependent listed in official records.

102
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:56,266
That said, it's vague enough in spoken Chinese to refer to a long-term, committed romantic partner. "Significant other" is the best translation here because it captures both the formal implication and the romantic intent 

103
00:10:56,266 --> 00:11:04,650
 (still, if you introduce someone as your 家属, people will likely assume you're cohabiting or married, or soon to be)

104
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:09,533
The air after the rain carries a touch of dampness, overlaying the lush greenery with gentle hues.

105
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:15,333
I steal a glance at Lucien beside me. He gazes calmly into the distance, but the relaxed curve of his brows and eyes quietly gives away the particularly good mood he's in.

106
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:20,683
My heart suddenly softens, as if delicate ripples spread over its innermost core, making it feel both warm and ticklish.

107
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:26,383
An hour ago, I received a call from Lucien saying he'd pick me up, and then he drove me to a park on the outskirts of Loveland City.

108
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:30,950
Lucien didn't explain much on the way. He didn't say whether he happened to be passing by or came on purpose, only mentioning casually that there was a place he wanted to go.

109
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,450
But I'm vaguely certain that this probably isn't a spur-of-the-moment act.

110
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,633
Be it his unintentional sigh at a red light or the slight acceleration of the car, all of it told me he was racing against time.

111
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:45,850
The world flowed between clarity and blur with the sweep of the windshield wipers. My curiosity gradually coalesced into anticipation.

112
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,883
I hope whatever he's so urgently trying to do will come true.

113
00:11:50,883 --> 00:11:57,650
As the car came down from the overpass, layers of green flooded into my view. In a trance, it felt as if I could hear nature breathing.

114
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,750
I think I know what Lucien is going to do.

115
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,100
As if to confirm the somewhat vague guess lingering in my heart, the rain stops five minutes after we park the car and walk into the park.

116
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,416
The coincidence guided by invisible hands feels especially romantic, and the instigator, too, seems satisfied with this outcome, making me unable to resist curling the corners of my lips.

117
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,450
MC: This almighty professor can even control the weather now.

118
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:24,350
Lucien: If I want to reach that level, I'm afraid I still need to make further efforts.

119
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,716
Lucien: But winning the race against the clouds does make me happy.

120
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:35,516
He speaks frankly, the tail end of his tone brisk, with even a hint of childlike satisfaction as he gently rubs my fingertips.

121
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:40,400
Seeing him like this, all I feel is fondness, and I feel happy too.

122
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,783
So I simply don't want to ask or to probe how he has done all of this.

123
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:49,750
It doesn't matter whether he's using scientific theory to run simulations and make predictions, using some powerful Evol, or really making a teru teru bozu in secret.

124
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,483
This brief period of clear sky that he has cherishingly placed in my hands is the only thing that matters.

125
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,666
Thinking this, I firmly clasp his hand.

126
00:12:55,666 --> 00:13:00,233
MC: So it turns out my 'universe' is right here. Then I have to hold on tight and enjoy the energy he brings.

127
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:05,433
Lucien: Is it that exaggerated? Then I can't help but feel proud.

128
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:10,683
MC: It absolutely isn't an exaggeration, I'm just really happy.

129
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:16,833
Lucien: Being the reason for your happiness is the best thing that could happen to me.

130
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,783
Lucien: Since the weather is so nice, let's walk a bit more.

131
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:26,716
Sunshine streams through the gaps in the heavy clouds. Yet, I feel an inexplicable profound fullness, as if I’ve been thoroughly bathed by the sun.

132
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:33,100
The fresh fragrance of grass brushes past my face, mingling with the scent on Lucien’s body. As it flows along our interlocked palms, it feels as though I’ve also been dyed with the same scent.

133
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:39,216
We just keep chatting like this as we circle around the park in a big loop. It’s only when we reach the far end opposite the entrance that the rain starts to fall again in a fine, steady drizzle.

134
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:45,033
While considering whether to have dinner nearby and wait until the evening rush hour ends before slowly heading home, two slightly hurried footsteps suddenly emerge through the patter of rain.

135
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,700
I reflexively look toward the sound and see two red figures swaying into view, like vermilion bleeding through a patch of mist.

136
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:56,300
A couple dressed in wedding attire walks briskly past us, arm in arm under an oil-paper umbrella, and enters an inconspicuous stone-step path off to the side.

137
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,233
Despite their hasty steps and the way their fragmented conversation dissolves into the rain, I always feel as if I can see their smiling faces and hear their beautiful prayers.

138
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:07,566
In that fleeting moment of trance, it feels as if two similar figures cross time and overlap before my eyes.

139
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:13,566
I belatedly withdraw my gaze, turn my head, and notice that Lucien's line of sight also stops at the end of the verdant expanse.

140
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:18,766
Lucien: Looks like… we've walked to the vicinity of the Yue Lao Temple (Matchmaker Temple).⁸

141
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:23,450
Lucien: It's just that we usually take the main road over there.

142
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:29,583
Following the direction of his finger, I take a closer look. At last, I catch a glimpse of something familiar and catch a faint whiff of sandalwood, dampened by the summer rain.

143
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:35,000
Lucien: The temple should still be open at this hour. Want to take a walk around?

144
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,500
MC: Eh?

145
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,116
Lucien: I think a certain young lady would like this kind of coincidence.

146
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:47,733
That pair of beautiful brows and eyes curves up slightly; the way he says this sentence makes it feel more like an invitation.

147
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:51,366
MC: Mm, I like it.

148
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:55,483
MC: But it’s not just the coincidence that I like.

149
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:59,366
I smile as I extend my pinky and hook it around his fingertip.

150
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:06,533
MC: Maybe Old Man Yue Lao missed us, so he guided us along this invisible red thread and brought us here.

151
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:12,233
There aren’t many visitors on rainy days. After lining up to make an incense offering and pay respects to the Matchmaker God, we find a pavilion and sit down.

152
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:17,700
Dense drizzle trails along the edge of the eaves and drips onto the stone steps, while bronze bells hanging from the pavilion corridor seem suspended in ethereal silence.

153
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,166
Time slows down. In the distance, blue-gray smoke merges into the rain mist, casting a hazy shadow beneath the pale daylight.

154
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,850
I sit side by side with Lucien, listening to the rain and watching the little orange cat sleeping soundly in the corner.

155
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,566
MC: I wonder what the kitten is dreaming about.

156
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:35,216
Lucien: Maybe it's chasing a butterfly.

157
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:41,250
As if it hears the humans talking, the little cat suddenly twitches its ears. Then it shifts its position, squints its eyes comfortably, stretches out its paws, and sprawls its belly open.

158
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,316
Lucien: Looks like it caught it.

159
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:49,700
While speaking, he naturally interlocks his fingers with mine, making my eyes curve in fond amusement.

160
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,733
A branch of the peach tree in the backyard peeks into view. The wind stirs the red silk ribbons at its tip. Though they make no noise, I seem to hear countless beautiful and romantic sounds.

161
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:59,616
MC: Lucien.

162
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:04,550
A sudden, slightly out-of-the-blue question comes to mind, and I gently scratch his palm.

163
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:11,100
MC: Do you think the red ribbons we tied to the tree before are still there?⁹

164
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,350
As if not expecting me to ask this, he hesitates for a few seconds before speaking.

165
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:26,916
Lucien: I'm curious too. Let's go, who knows what kind of answer the world will give us.

166
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:33,100
The peach tree is as tall as the one in my memory. It gently holds up countless red ribbons, overlooking these stories and participating in their happening.

167
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,516
There are people closing their eyes and devoutly making wishes. Some are tiptoeing toward the tips of the branches to tie red ribbons, and others are solemnly putting pen to paper at the nearby wish-writing table.

168
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:44,166
Time moves forward in silence, giving birth to countless changes, yet it also seems to leave behind some things that never change.

169
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:49,516
How strange, I've clearly been to the Matchmaker Temple several times before, but standing under the tree like this, it feels like it was already a long time ago.

170
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:54,800
I can't explain why it's today of all days, perhaps I simply want to take a look.

171
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,400
The peach tree, along its swaying shadows, still sheds unceasing water droplets. They glide along the ribbons, falling one after another as though in reply.

172
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,416
The rain has stopped again without our noticing. Fluttering ribbons replace sunset light buried in the clouds, lifting a heart-stirring flush of red.

173
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,850
Pulling Lucien along, I tilt my head up and circle the tree back and forth, my whole vision filled with swaying red.

174
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,650
Vivid red, hazy red, faded red—these are the heart-pounding colors on lovers' cheeks as they offer prayers and wishes.

175
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,800
After looking for a long time, it feels as though an afterimage has been seared onto my retina. I rub my eyes, and when I turn my head, I bump into a gaze that’s been fixed on me the whole time.

176
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,316
I feel embarrassed under his stare and reach out to poke the tip of his nose.

177
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:26,833
MC: Do you think I'm being a bit childish?

178
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,450
Lucien: Of course not.

179
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,950
Lucien: I was also seriously looking just now. It's just that...

180
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,100
He leans down, pressing close to my ear, and whispers.

181
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:48,050
Lucien: The elderly gentleman at the wish-writing desk seems to have taken us for strange folks. He's been glancing our way on and off several times.

182
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:59,433
Lucien: Honestly, I was just thinking about how I should explain to him if he got really curious and came over to us.

183
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:04,250
I blink and peek out from beside Lucien. Sure enough, I see the old gentleman he mentioned watching us with a cautious look on his face.

184
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,583
Imagining how we must look to others, I smile embarrassedly.

185
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,583
MC: Let's just say we're making a TV show and doing on-site research? Or maybe gathering material?

186
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,300
Lucien: Do we really need such a formal reason?

187
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,966
Lucien: I rather think the Matchmaker God would prefer our most genuine intentions.

188
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:26,816
Lucien smiles as he tucks a loose strand of my hair behind my ear.

189
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:39,150
Lucien: My beloved has a heart that is both pure and romantic. She wishes to take hold once more of the happiness and destined bond that belong to us.…¹⁰

190
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:45,466
Lucien: And I hope her wish will be fulfilled.

191
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:49,883
His voice is not loud, yet it carries a certain weight of cherishing care and heartfelt earnestness. Heavily it lands upon my heart, slowing and magnifying everything.

192
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:55,983
Thump-thump—a sound.

193
00:18:55,983 --> 00:19:04,233
Thump-thump—another follows close behind.

194
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:10,066
I instinctively look back into those deep eyes and see all the colors in the world merging within them. Even the swaying, flowing red is wholly dyed in his color.

195
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:17,316
Through those eyes, I seem to have found what I have been searching for all along.

196
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:27,766
⁸: It’s the same Matchmaker Temple they visited years ago in 不负相思意 SP (Bound by Love SP) Mind Quest. This temple is dedicated to Yue Lao (月老), also known as the Old Man Under the Moon, a deity in Chinese folklore who presides over love and marriage.

197
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:39,483
The myth of the red thread of fate originates from him. He is said to connect destined couples with an invisible red thread, binding their fates together. Though the thread may stretch, tangle, or twist, it is said to never break, symbolizing a bond that defies time, distance, obstacles, and even death~

198
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:54,833
In temple tradition, couples tie red silk ribbons onto sacred trees, symbolizing the red thread of fate used by Yue Lao to bind destined lovers. This act is a prayer for eternal union and divine blessing. Lucien and MC follow this custom at the Matchmaker Temple in 不负相思意 SP (Bound by Love SP) Mind Quest.

199
00:19:54,833 --> 00:20:06,333
In traditional belief, when two people tie their red silk ribbons together on a sacred tree, it signifies “以树为媒，天地作证” — taking the tree as matchmaker, with heaven and earth as witnesses to their union. This transforms their simple act of tying ribbons into a sacred vow, witnessed by the universe and divine worlds.

200
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:11,166
¹⁰ : The original line is 我的爱人有一颗纯粹又浪漫的心,她想回握住一份属于我们的幸福和缘分...…There are three terms that I want to highlight: 我的爱人 (wǒ de àirén), 幸福 (xìng fú) , and 缘分 (yuán fèn)

201
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:15,633
我的爱人 (wǒ de àirén) literally means “my loved person”/“the one I love” (我的 = my/mine; 爱人 = love + person). From the 1950s to the 1990s in Mainland China, 爱人 was the common word for spouse.

202
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:19,683
Today, it may sound somewhat old-fashioned and sentimental in daily speech, but it still conveys a long-term commitment, carrying the sense of 'the person I'll love for my whole life.'

203
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:23,683
It can be translated as 'my beloved' in emotional contexts, but if you use it to introduce your partner (as Lucien does in other dates), people will assume you mean a spouse or at least a lifelong partner.

204
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:28,316
幸福 (xìng fú) is more than just “happiness.” Unlike 高兴 or 开心, which describe passing moods, 幸福 refers to a deep, lasting sense of fulfillment, often tied to love, family, and emotional well-being.

205
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:32,000
So the 'happiness' that MC wishes for leans closer to 'a blessed, fulfilling, and content life' rather than a temporary happiness.

206
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,450
缘分 (yuán fèn) is a concept rooted in a synthesis of Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian thought. It refers to a predestined affinity that brings people together, yet also implies personal effort to maintain and deepen that bond.

207
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,500
It consists of 缘 (yuán)— the karmic condition or circumstantial force that allows people to cross paths; and 分 (fèn)—which signifies voluntary effort, personal choice, or one's 'share' of the relationship.

208
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,783
Unlike the passive Western notion of 'fate', yuánfèn encompasses both cosmic serendipity and human agency. I think TL it as 'destined bond' better captures its meaning: a relationship brought forth by unseen forces, but sustained through mutual intention and care.

209
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,250
Even though he had already sat down in the driver's seat, Lucien still couldn't help but take another glance at the tablet screen before starting the car.

210
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:56,183
The tablet had been remotely connected to the computer in the laboratory and was currently transmitting radar echoes, short-term forecasts, and various meteorological data to him in real-time.

211
00:20:56,183 --> 00:21:03,133
He specifically applied for temporary access from the meteorological research department, obtained partial data, and used it in combination with the Meteorological Administration’s technology to create a simple climate simulation model.

212
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:08,000
Considering that the closer it is to the target time, the more accurate the weather forecast becomes, he further increased the frequency of data refresh.

213
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,183
In fact, Lucien's goal was simple: to do everything possible to ensure he could truly 'capture' that brief window of clear sky during this extended rainy season.

214
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:20,433
That way, he could naturally share what felt like a destined bit of 'good luck' with her.

215
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:25,266
But when it came down to it, his 'Sunny-Weather Capture Plan' had actually been in effect for three or four days.

216
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:32,250
The last time he predicted the rain would stop, he had just gotten ready to head out when the weather suddenly turned against him, and the plan had to be called off.

217
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,616
The time before that, he had caught a window between rain clouds, but was unfortunately held up by an unexpected meeting.

218
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:42,300
If he missed the chance again this time, the next brief spell of sunshine wouldn’t arrive until the following week.

219
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,433
He had to admit, tailoring luck in a field he wasn't very familiar with turned out to be a bit more troublesome than he had imagined.

220
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:50,133
The lingering drizzle wouldn't stop, and of all times, a red light brought him to a halt again.

221
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:54,466
After a fleeting glance at the tablet and confirming the model again, Lucien's eyes drifted toward the low-hanging clouds, and he let out a soft sigh.

222
00:21:54,466 --> 00:22:00,216
Lucien: ...I should still make it in time.

223
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:04,766
He had always considered himself fairly patient, yet now, he found himself lightly tapping the steering wheel again and again.

224
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:08,983
The image of the girl’s smiling eyes flashed through his mind, followed by the plans he had prepared.

225
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:14,233
Lucien tried to tell himself that even if he didn't make it in time for the sunny weather, it didn’t matter. He had made thorough preparations anyway—

226
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:19,750
If it still rained, there was an umbrella with a jellyfish pattern in the trunk, which would most likely make her light up with delighted surprise.¹¹

227
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,050
Or he could simply turn the car around and take her to the plum garden he had booked to taste the freshly brewed plum wine.¹²

228
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,950
If all else failed… he could still pretend that he merely happened to be passing by because of some coincidence.

229
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:37,033
He would just drive her home, listen as she shared glimpses of her workday, and then, together, choose a movie suited for a rainy day.

230
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:41,983
He had crafted every possible contingency plan; each one certain to please her. But...

231
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:46,066
Lucien: If only the sky would clear up for a little while.

232
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:50,600
Lucien: Just a brief moment would be enough.

233
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,400
When it comes to things related to her, he always wants to be a little greedier.

234
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:04,483
Even this elusive luck, he longs to grasp it in his hands, polish it into a glittering gift with his heartfelt intentions, delicately adorn it with surprises, wrap it all up, and hold it out before her eyes.¹³

235
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:11,133
And receive in return her eyes instantly lighting up as she beams and throws herself into his embrace.

236
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:15,300
He smiled and sighed, not knowing whether this was the hundredth time he had gazed at his tablet during this stretch of time that was neither long nor short.

237
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:20,116
The model's predicted result remains unchanged; it still indicates that the overcast rain will briefly pause in an hour and a half.

238
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:25,316
This time, he didn't wait any longer. He lit up his phone and dialed her number.

239
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:30,000
Lucien: It's me. Is the shoot going well?

240
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,400
Lucien: Actually, I'm currently on my way to the set. I'll be there in a bit…

241
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,550
The green light turned on, and Lucien stepped on the accelerator again, moving forward along the lane.

242
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:49,650
Heading toward the clear sky belonging to him.

243
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:57,416
¹¹: This is more of a trivia than an serious insight, I just find it really cute that jellyfish is one of the animals associated with him~ It appear as… ahem… euphemistic imagery during 2023 his flower banner.

244
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:05,250
They also appear in the 2022 Lovepro X Shining Nikki Collab, his 2024 White Day R karma, and the 2023 summer event, where he purchased three Moon Jellyfish for their summer café. It is also creatively used again in euphemistic writing, as they do ‘this and that’ in the said café.

245
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:12,633
¹²: The plum wine is not just a sweet random idea and rather a direct callback to 山野之约 (Wilderness Date), the one date where they pick green plums and taste sweet, spicy, and sour homemade plum wine in the summer of 2021 🥺

246
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:20,300
Probably just a small detail, but I want to point it out, because it makes it feel like every moment from the past matters, like all those memories, no matter how small they seem, shape who he is today, and how he continues to treasure them.

247
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:28,883
¹³: The way that line strongly echoes what MC said back in Sweet Dream Date (which, in the CN server, takes place in summer 2024) makes me want to cry (இ﹏இ`｡) He’s really someone who pays such tender attention, quietly cherishing every little fragment of her, even things that she doesn't say, 

248
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:36,366
polishing them with his heart then treasures them, and present them back to his beloved as if the universe itself had a hand in them. Every gift from him carries special meaning, and they are the very proof of his sincerest love for her🥺

249
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:43,750
MC: You saw them too, right? Those are precisely the red ribbons we tied back then!

250
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,433
MC: I remember we tied one ribbon first, then tied the other one on top of it. That's why the knot looks like that… Anyway, I'm sure of it.

251
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:51,816
MC: I never expected that they had neither been routinely cleared away nor worn down by wind and rain, but instead still hang there on the tree, perfectly intact…

252
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:56,500
MC: ...It's truly wondrous.

253
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:03,133
On our way back from the Matchmaker Temple, I'm still chattering away, relishing what just happened.¹⁴

254
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:08,150
The last wash of sunset glow tints the horizon a beautiful pinkish purple, its hue soaking into the damp stone steps.

255
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,833
Lucien doesn't say a word the whole time, just smiles as he listens to me.

256
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:18,183
Looking at those smiling eyes, I clear my throat a little, feeling slightly embarrassed.

257
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,466
MC: Alright, I admit that after years of absorbing your influence by osmosis, I've become a bit more realistic and pragmatic.

258
00:25:22,466 --> 00:25:30,316
MC: But we've experienced so many miraculous moments over the past two days… Like we're being watched over with fondness and blessed by grace. It's both wondrous and blissful.

259
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:33,916
MC: So I can't help but feel deeply moved.

260
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:39,683
Lucien: I know. That's why I'm relishing it too.

261
00:25:39,683 --> 00:25:44,366
MC: Liar, that smile of yours looks like you’re teasing me.

262
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:49,450
Lucien: Would I really be that mean?

263
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:58,950
Lucien: I honestly just think you're utterly endearing. The world looks beautiful and full of wonder when seen through your eyes.

264
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:04,766
Lucien: It responded to your hopes and brought us miracles.

265
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:09,616
The evening breeze blows softly, and the world melts into a rustling expanse of tender hue.

266
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:18,316
Lucien: And ever since being with you, I keep encountering many illogical, low-probability events that call to be pursued and explored.

267
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:27,383
Lucien: Your existence has made me accustomed to miracles happening naturally.

268
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:32,783
Lucien: Isn't this miraculous?

269
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:37,200
Rather than a question, it feels more like he's marveling.

270
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,916
How could I not be lucky too—to be the curiosity of the one who's curious about the world, to be the exploration he longs to explore.

271
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:46,500
I can't help but rise onto my tiptoes and plant a soft peck at the corner of his lips.

272
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,183
MC: Alright, alright, I can't out-argue you. I give up.¹⁵

273
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:55,150
Lucien: That won't do.

274
00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:01,416
He leans in, and his warm breath falls upon my squinting eyes and the tip of my nose, before finally coming to rest at the edge of my lips.

275
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:07,566
Lucien: Just let me be the one to admit defeat.¹⁶

276
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:16,033
The lights along the stone-step path light up one by one; the already long mountain trail grows slower beneath our pace, as if we tacitly wish to prolong this moment.

277
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:19,583
I gently shake our clasped hands.

278
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:29,183
MC: Speaking of which, have you still gone to the Matchmaker Temple by yourself again since then?¹⁷
//⚠️'Since then' here does not refer to the 'Bound by Love' SP Mind Quest. Please refer to the [Translation Notes and Insights] for context. This clarification is critical as the date being referenced may not be released on the EN server for quite some time.⚠️//

279
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:37,133
Lucien: No, I haven't. But I did visit Grandma Wen a while ago; she can vouch for that.

280
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:41,383
MC: Pfft, I never said I didn't believe you.

281
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:47,600
Seeing him explain so seriously, I can't help but laugh.

282
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,766
MC: Lucien, let's visit the temple together from now on.¹⁸

283
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:59,700
Lucien: Okay.

284
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,533
Lucien agrees almost without hesitation.

285
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:08,083
He doesn't ask me the reason, and only responds with an earnestness that makes it more of a promise than a reply.

286
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:13,600
I actually can't explain exactly what I'm thinking in this moment, or why I'd make a promise about something that doesn't seem to need promising at all.

287
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,566
Perhaps it's just because I'm walking with him like this that I unintentionally begin to freely imagine many distant things.

288
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:23,183
They all will happen naturally on some day in the future.

289
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:28,333
Somehow, I suddenly remember that promise.

290
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:35,183
It always lies deep in my memories, silent and still, yet deafening whenever I recall it.

291
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:40,933
I instinctively look toward Lucien.

292
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:48,100
When the weather is good, let's go fly a kite.

293
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:55,800
I think about it, and the memory alone makes my heart clamor.

294
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,950
The evening breeze brushes past the shrubs, sweeps over the hem of my skirt, and stirs the ends of Lucien's hair.

295
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,066
Perhaps I'm too deeply lost in thought; it's only when that profound gaze looks back at me that I sheepishly avert my eyes.

296
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,883
MC: What is it?

297
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:10,366
A soft chuckle falls on my ear, and Lucien smiles as he boops my nose.

298
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:20,933
Lucien: I admit it. I really like it when you look at me like this. In fact, I don't want to interrupt this moment either.

299
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:26,700
MC: Humph, and yet you still interrupted me?

300
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:32,833
I figure he's probably teasing me again, so I just go along with what he says. But to my surprise, he ends up looking even more innocent.

301
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:39,000
Lucien: What if I tell you I have a good reason?

302
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:50,666
Lucien: There's a beautiful scene I don't want you to miss. Or rather, I want to experience it together with you.

303
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:55,616
As Lucien speaks, he takes my hand and steps down a stair, guiding my gaze forward.

304
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:59,250
The next second, I can't help but widen my eyes.

305
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,566
MC: ...Fireflies!

306
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:11,433
Scattered luminescence flows out unceasingly from the bushes, like sprinkles of stardust adrift before our eyes.

307
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:17,000
Drifting and floating, they converge into a swaying galaxy, like a gift from the gods.

308
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:23,950
Lucien watches the girl beside him, her smile blooming and the glow of fireflies leaping into her eyes. He can't help but smile too.

309
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:30,100
In truth, he's the one who should be grateful.

310
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:36,066
Without her, he himself probably wouldn't have seen such a dreamlike and beautiful scene.

311
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:41,816
And the moment his gaze shifts away from her, the world fades back into a photographic negative needing to be refocused.

312
00:30:41,816 --> 00:30:47,316
So he instinctively tightens his grip on her hand, as if this way he holds not only her joy, but his own as well.

313
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:53,050
Now, he seems to have gradually learned how to hold onto this beautiful miracle.

314
00:30:53,050 --> 00:31:00,000
What he said is true: the way she's made him grow accustomed to miracles and beauty is far more miraculous than any so-called coincidence.

315
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,700
He quietly watches the girl, watches her gaze turn toward him, watches her eyes brim with delight.

316
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,833
Lucien feels love.

317
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:17,533
He inexplicably thinks of this word, even though he still cannot define it.

318
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:23,400
It’s born alongside too many emotions; it makes him unlike himself, yet through him, it allows him to become himself.

319
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:32,566
His heart throbs uncontrollably. The feeling of his chest being completely filled, just like it was at the Matchmaker Temple, comes flooding back again.

320
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:38,183
They stood side by side, gazing together at the peach tree, which was covered with red silk ribbons.

321
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:43,300
Vast expanses of green and red permeated the world, as if becoming the only two fragments of color left. For a moment, he felt as though everything had reverted to a single hue once more.

322
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,950
Equally monotonous, yet so different from black and white.

323
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,733
The colors now had warmth and were tangible to the touch, making him unable to resist closing his fingers tighter around hers.

324
00:31:52,733 --> 00:32:00,016
And this warmth enveloped him as tenaciously as a miracle. He couldn’t help but keep confirming, keep turning back, always looking toward the girl by his side who had brought it all into being.

325
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:05,950
How can I tell you just how miraculous you are?

326
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:09,883
Lucien thought to himself.

327
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:15,666
She tilted her head up, searching with unblinking focus, as if she would never back down or give up no matter what.

328
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:19,400
And he knows why she is so persistent and perseverant.¹⁹

329
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:25,783
He happens to be her persistence and perseverance.

330
00:32:25,783 --> 00:32:32,366
Lucien's gaze lightly swept over the others beneath the tree. Though he couldn't know what was in their hearts and minds, he genuinely sensed similar emotions.

331
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:36,850
He, too, has someone who would naturally appear in his heart at this moment.

332
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,700
It turns out time can roll back, like the returning surge of a rising tide.

333
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:48,966
The flower that quietly bloomed in the depths of his heart has now blossomed into a form he had never foreseen, gently and steadily cradling his abnormally pounding heart.

334
00:32:50,933 --> 00:32:56,433
The fireflies illuminate her, and they also illuminate his pain and obsession.²⁰

335
00:32:56,433 --> 00:33:01,550
And yet, each increment of pain feels even more like the most solid proof transmitted from his heart.

336
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:09,000
It is as if the world is tenderly opening its embrace, welcoming its clumsy child to experience and enjoy the most touching and profound beauty of life.

337
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,616
He softly speaks her name, grasping with his own hands a certain kind of fate that belongs only to him.

338
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:24,716
Lucien: Tomorrow… let’s go fly a kite.

339
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:31,800
I like how the story is structured so that the kite isn't something he plans in advance because of a lucky day. Heck, the kite isn't even on their minds when they first hear about it. Instead, the idea of a "lucky day" pushes them to show their dedication to each other in parallel: she insists on finding the red ribbon, while he works tirelessly to catch a fleeting patch of sunshine. 

340
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,533
Both of them are collecting small pieces of luck for a future they can already sense but haven't yet put into words. And when persistence and chance come together, those little pieces of luck gently and naturally bring back the memory of the kite promise🥺

341
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:46,566
¹⁴: 回 (huí) means 'to return', and 味 (wèi) means 'taste'. Together, 回味 (huíwèi) literally means 'to return to the taste' and figuratively refers to savoring a past experience or emotion. What I mean by 'relishing' here is not just enjoying, but savoring in a thoughtful, gentle way like 'tasting' memories that linger.

342
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:52,266
¹⁵⁺¹⁶: MC's 投降 (tóuxiáng) is a term for formal surrender (e.g., in war). It's precisely the formality that makes its use in a daily context playful and theatrical, like declaring a dramatic defeat or waving a white flag LOL.

343
00:33:52,266 --> 00:34:01,616
Lucien's 认输 (rènshū) means 'to admit defeat' and is more personal and introspective. It refers to an internal acknowledgment of loss, often after a struggle. By choosing this word, he gently rejects her theatrical gesture to instead make a sincere and vulnerable concession, acknowledging that he is the one truly overcome🥺

344
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:07,683
The phrase "since then" in MC's line refers back to the Binding Knot Date, where Grandma Wen (also the same Grandma Wen from Chapter 9 who taught MC how to make a peace knot) pulls MC aside and reveals that Lucien has visited the Matchmaker Temple alone on several occasions. 

345
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:13,266
MC later confronts him about it, asking if he's encountered a problem that 'materialism' can't solve. Lucien admits he goes there to seek comfort regarding his relationship with MC, worrying that his mistakes might make her unhappy and wondering if he's not doing well enough.

346
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:18,833
A 'materialist' who goes against logic for his beloved because matters of the heart are too complex to explain through reason alone… this reflects a key stage in his character development. 

347
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:24,450
This date also shows how much he pays attention even to their smallest quarrels, learning to see them as a natural part of being in a relationship. Anyway, MC's question here checks if he has resumed his habit of seeking solitary solace.

348
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:30,950
¹⁸: By asking Lucien to visit the Matchmaker Temple together from now on, MC not only breaks his pattern of carrying worries alone but also turns it into a shared promise for their road ahead.

349
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:36,966
The act itself carries cultural undertones, as visiting the temple as a couple is often tied to love and long-term commitment, which is why her thoughts naturally drift toward their future. And Lucien's simple, sincere "Okay" lands like a vow of its own, affirming her proposal🥺

350
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:43,183
¹⁹: While both 执着 (zhí zhuó) and 坚持 (jiān chí) can be translated as 'persistence', their connotations are different. 执着 (zhí zhuó) describes a state of mind, a deep, often stubborn or obsessive attachment to an idea, goal, or person. At the same time, 坚持 (jiān chí) focuses on the action of continuing to do something despite difficulties.

351
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:50,283
坚持 (jiān chí) emphasizes steadfastness, endurance, and willpower in upholding principles, habits, or plans. MC's 执着 is her profound emotional fixation on Lucien, and this feeling is what fuels her 坚持, her unwavering effort and perseverance in their relationship. 

352
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:54,566
It's almost silly how they've become each other's embodiment of what defines them. Like for MC, Lucien is her persistence and perseverance; for Lucien, MC is his curiosity and quest.

353
00:34:54,566 --> 00:35:02,433
²⁰: The term 沉迷 consists of two characters: 沉 (chén): 'to sink' or 'to be immersed in' and 迷 (mí): 'to be fascinated by', 'to be lost in', or 'to be obsessed with'. The literal meaning of 沉迷 is 'to sink into and become lost in a fascination'. It evokes someone willingly allowing themselves to be submerged and enchanted by something,

354
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:10,183
to the point of losing their bearings in anything else. I use obsession to translate 沉迷 because it is a good approximation, but maybe it can't fully capture the sinking (沉) feeling, like this all-consuming, overwhelming absorption in her and his love for her.

355
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:17,650
Dark blue night spills across the windshield; streetlights sweep past within sight, transforming into flowing amber on the damp road.

356
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:23,800
I can't help but sneak another glance from the corner of my eye, catching a glimpse of Lucien's calm, unchanged expression.

357
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,066
I had thought that after his invitation, we would go buy a kite together.

358
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:32,066
But as we pass by several malls or supermarkets that appear to sell kites along the way, he shows almost no intention of stopping the car, and there is even a trace of inexplicable silence.

359
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:35,433
Could it be that he has already quietly prepared something without my knowing?

360
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:41,550
I can't quite make sense of it, but helpless against too many indescribable emotions flooding my mind, I don't break this silence either.

361
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,933
Any moment now, once we turn at the next intersection, we'll be home...

362
00:35:44,933 --> 00:35:49,166
Lucien: MC, we're almost home.

363
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:54,283
MC: Ah… yeah, we are. What is it?

364
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:59,300
I subconsciously hold my breath.

365
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,883
Lucien: Want to grab a late-night snack at that food stall nearby?

366
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:07,983
MC: …Well, okay.

367
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:13,700
I stretch the corner of my mouth into a reluctant smile and agree, then immediately feel somewhat annoyed at my undisciplined emotions getting the better of me.

368
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:22,450
Perhaps it is because tonight is one of these recent nights when the rain has rarely stopped that the food stalls are bustling at this hour. Cooking smoke mingles with the damp air, steaming up into a hazy mist.

369
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:28,650
The savory aroma of barbecue burrows into my nose, and amid the leaping charcoal fire and the clinking of glasses, it sketches a clamorous, warmly human bustle.

370
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,650
Lucien and I simply order some food and sit down at one of the outdoor seats.

371
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,200
The night's temperature sheds the day's mugginess, soft and fresh as if rinsed clean by rain.

372
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,600
Lucien: The weather forecast says there’s about an 80% chance of rain tomorrow.

373
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,716
MC: Pfft… So that's what you were looking at all along?

374
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:53,066
From those deep-set eyes, a sliver of resignation seeps out without the slightest concealment. Lucien sets down his phone, naturally peeling a shrimp and placing it into my bowl.

375
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:56,866
Lucien: Fortunately, there's still a 20% chance.

376
00:36:56,866 --> 00:37:01,550
MC: [smiles softly] Why does it sound like you're cheering yourself up, Professor Xu?

377
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:08,533
Lucien: Was it that obvious? I was clearly trying to come off a bit more nonchalant.

378
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:13,483
He speaks with feigned gravity, his half-joking tone making us laugh in unison; yet I faintly sense the emotions concealed within it.

379
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:17,866
The night wind blows gently, the lamplight at the shop entrance softly melts into the puddle on the ground, forming a fuzzy-edged moon—

380
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:21,666
—as if it too illuminates the thoughts weighing on my heart.

381
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:27,433
Be it 20% or 10%; even if only a faint 1% glimmer of possibility- at this moment, I greedily hope that tomorrow can be that one luckiest day of ours.

382
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:31,900
I hope tomorrow will be good weather.²¹

383
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,266
After we finish dinner and return home, Lucien heads straight into the bathroom.

384
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:44,666
On this night no different from any other, it is I who finds myself a little absent-minded.

385
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:48,883
While thinking over the matter of the kite and worrying about the change in weather, I push open the bathroom door with my change of clothes in hand, just in time to see Lucien taking off his shirt.

386
00:37:48,883 --> 00:37:51,466
Lucien: …..

387
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:54,350
MC: ……

388
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:59,733
MC: ...Y-you haven't showered yet? Then hurry up, okay?

389
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:06,116
I babble incoherently with awkward laughter, slam the door shut in one motion, then shake my head hard, trying to jolt my muddled mind a little clearer.

390
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:09,883
Immediately after, I hear two light knocks coming from the other side of the door.

391
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:14,566
Lucien: If you're in a hurry, I can let you go first.

392
00:38:14,566 --> 00:38:23,783
Lucien: Of course. I'd also be very happy to leave this time for us to share together.

393
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:27,700
MC: Stop teasing me, just hurry up and get in!

394
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,750
Lucien: [chuckles] Then I'll be quick.

395
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:36,250
Soon, steam infused with the scent of body wash wafts up, and my face belatedly grows a little warm.

396
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,133
Hugging the clothes to my chest, I sit down on the sofa and subconsciously glance out the window again.

397
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:47,133
Maybe it's just a psychological effect, but ever since finding out the forecast, I find myself constantly paying attention to the 'weather'.

398
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:54,683
The muffled thunder from the distant horizon, the water droplets shaken loose from the tree branches by the wind, even the gurgling of water coming from the bathroom at this moment...

399
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:58,650
Each one keeps magnifying in my ears and before my eyes.

400
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,316
And weirdly enough, this state lingers on and off all the way until just before I fall asleep.

401
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:07,383
Listening to the steady breathing of the person beside me, I suddenly feel a bit unsure whether he's actually asleep or not.

402
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:11,950
My continuously sinking consciousness is tugged at by scattered, trivial thoughts, as if caught in an intangible tug-of-war.

403
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:19,133
I don't know how much time has passed. Amid the hazy daze, I hear the sound of raindrops falling.

404
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:34,900
²¹: The way that line is precisely the same as what MC said back in Sacred Mountain Date Official Translation🤧 These are the same emotional gesture: MC clings to a sliver of possibility despite the snow, wind, and rain with both the Golden Mountain and the flying kite being symbols of improbable fortune… 

405
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:50,983
Thinking about it, their relationship is inextricably tied to luck, isn't it? From their first love token being iridescent, a symbol of (rainbow) luck, to the golden mountain, then a game in his 2024 Birthday in CN server, where it's only when he gives himself a bit of luck that he finally meets her, even if it took him 500 years. 

406
00:39:50,983 --> 00:39:54,583
Meeting her in the first place is perhaps his greatest stroke of 'luck' that even if it brings him pain and destruction, he accepts it not as resignation but as devoted willingness, that he'd choose it again and again, no matter the cost.

407
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:59,600
Still, it’s essential to recognize that it isn't luck alone that keeps them together. Just as Joshua/Zeng Shu's research required years of effort before that small stroke of luck arrived, Lucien insistently tries to tailor luck for her, and MC just as persistently seeks out the red ribbon they tied together years ago to hold onto their destined bond,

408
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,950
 the story makes it clear that although luck is a theme, their meeting, their effort to keep being together through learning and understanding how to open their heart and love each other, and later the fulfillment of the kite promise are never just mere chance, but something shaped through intention, persistence, and deliberate choices that wait for a little bit of luck to come.

409
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:08,616
I’m still a bit dazed as I walk into the park.

410
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:12,533
The humming of the early morning downpour still echoes in my ears, while the lingering moisture in the air has quietly evaporated in the sunlight.

411
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:17,216
Though it's not yet noon, the blazing sunshine tears through the clouds and slants downward, spreading across the vast green shade. Like a frozen scene, only the clamorous cries of cicadas remain.

412
00:40:17,216 --> 00:40:20,750
I feel my whole body heating up, and for a moment, I can't tell whether it's from the sun or from the warmth in my heart.

413
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,166
As I sneak a glance for the umpteenth time at the kite in Lucien's other hand, he suddenly gives my hand a slight squeeze.

414
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:27,683
Feeling caught, I hurriedly raised my other hand to fan myself.

415
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:31,900
MC: With the sun so blazing now, who would've thought it was pouring just this early morning?

416
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,483
Lucien narrows his eyes slightly, a meaningful smile playing on his lips.

417
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:42,233
Lucien: It turns out a certain little lady really was awake at that time.

418
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,150
MC: …..

419
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,650
MC: Since you put it that way, Professor Xu… that means you weren't asleep either then.

420
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:54,683
Lucien: Oh, so you really have been awake the whole time too.

421
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:59,250
He leisurely draws out his sigh, making me feel even hotter. So I huff twice and deliberately purse my lips.

422
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,466
MC: If I had known it'd turn out like this, we might as well have chatted and tried to get sleepy together.

423
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:08,316
Lucien: Then I'm afraid we really would've ended up pulling an all-nighter.

424
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:11,383
MC: Why's that?

425
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:17,150
Lucien: After all, in moments like these, I always seem to have so much I want to say to you.

426
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,966
He speaks candidly, making me feel that no matter what he says, I won't be able to refuse.

427
00:41:20,966 --> 00:41:23,050
MC: Then I'd only feel very happy.

428
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,516
Lucien: Can just this alone bring happiness?

429
00:41:26,516 --> 00:41:30,666
MC: Of course, because I got to hear your heart.

430
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:34,983
I lead Lucien by the hand toward the lawn deep in the park, passing puddles at our feet and a tree strewn with fallen blossoms.

431
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:37,533
For a while, neither of us speaks, and my heart grows very quiet.

432
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:41,216
Then I hear Lucien speak.

433
00:41:41,216 --> 00:41:52,250
Lucien: Actually, when it started raining before dawn, I felt uneasy, defeated, and dejected. Even…

434
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,833
Lucien: Anticipation.

435
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:58,716
His voice sounds softly, causing me to subconsciously soften my breathing as well.

436
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:05,850
Lucien: I can't help but think, perhaps my invitation was too sudden.

437
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:17,033
Lucien: I should have given it more thought, or rather, done some more preparation. At the very least, I should've checked the weather forecast before inviting you.

438
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:21,750
He shrugs his shoulders with a smile, and I follow suit, lifting the corners of my mouth. But his joking line inexplicably scratches at my heart, making it itch.

439
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:30,466
Lucien: Failure is the norm if one insists on advancing a difficult experiment under uncontrollable conditions.

440
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:38,050
Lucien: But unfortunately, cognition and choice are not always aligned.

441
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:46,683
Lucien: The thought that my impulsiveness might cause your expectation to come to nothing leaves me somewhat unwilling to accept it.

442
00:42:46,683 --> 00:42:51,766
As he speaks with sincerity, I suddenly realize why the person lying beside me would be so silent when the rain poured like a torrent.

443
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:54,600
MC: Ah, people really are so different from one another.

444
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,716
MC: While Professor Xu reflected on himself when he couldn't sleep, I thought about nothing at all.

445
00:42:57,716 --> 00:43:01,400
Hearing my exaggerated sigh, Lucien turns toward me with keen interest in his eyes.

446
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,283
Lucien: Weren't you worried?

447
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:08,000
MC: If I had to put it into words, later on I kept feeling like… none of it mattered.

448
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,150
MC: Whether it's a magical rainy-day kite that exceeded expectations, or the two of us waiting together for the clear skies to arrive.

449
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:17,483
MC: Maybe we'll make a promise for the next time the weather is nice, or maybe you'll take me somewhere even farther away, to a place full of sunshine. What words would you say to me then?

450
00:43:17,483 --> 00:43:23,066
Lucien: "The world is a vast place—not everywhere is caught in rain."

451
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:27,066
I blink a few times, then laugh together with him.

452
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:31,066
MC: Professor Xu, have you 'rehearsed' this response too?

453
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:36,683
Lucien: I’m simply in the habit of preparing for all kinds of hypothetical scenarios.

454
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:40,833
MC: Then, did our Professor Xu spend the whole night rehearsing hypotheticals without sleeping properly?

455
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:45,716
Lucien: I fell asleep after the rain stopped, and I slept very well.

456
00:43:45,716 --> 00:43:49,933
Lucien: Because what I had been anticipating happened.

457
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:52,350
MC: Was it the rain stopping?

458
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,150
Lucien: It was a miracle.

459
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:01,116
Lucien: After the rain, I began to anticipate a miracle.

460
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:11,083
Lucien: They heard how devout I was, so the whole world came to help.²²

461
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:17,216
As Lucien speaks these words, dappled light happens to leap onto his brows, the corners of his eyes, and the tips of his hair, making his eyes sparkle brightly.

462
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:23,933
Lucien: MC, right now I feel that today might just be our luckiest day of the year.

463
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:30,066
His brows and eyes curve with a smile, making no attempt to hide just how happy he is. Being gazed at like this by him, my eyes can’t help but grow hot.

464
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:35,100
MC: It's all my fault. I shouldn't have dragged you into those superstitious activities.

465
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,666
Lucien: That's right, you'll have to take responsibility.

466
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:47,633
As we speak, a vast lawn comes into view, emerald green spreading as far as the eye can reach, appearing supple under the sunlight.

467
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:51,466
Nameless little flowers dot the grass, and heaven and earth are condensed into dewdrops on the branches and leaves, like a world held in stillness.

468
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:54,966
It truly is good weather today.t truly is good weather today.

469
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:58,366
The only thing is that it's too still.

470
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:04,416
Lucien: …..

471
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:07,866
Lucien comes to a stop, his chest involuntarily rising and falling faintly.

472
00:45:07,866 --> 00:45:11,633
Under the scorching sun, his repeated running causes him to sweat lightly, and his bared skin is also tinged with a faint flush from the heat.

473
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:18,816
Lucien: …I'll try again.

474
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:22,616
After finishing his words, he places the kite onto the grass, continuously tugging at the spool as he moves backward, then starts jogging again.

475
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:26,083
I promptly follow in his footsteps.

476
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:30,783
MC: Lucien, move a little to the left… no no—your left!

477
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:34,666
MC: …Wait, don't pull the string yet!

478
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:41,383
He follows each instruction, but the kite's clean paper surface only sweeps over the grass again and again, the pink ribbons tied to it like strands of fish lingering and swimming among the blades.

479
00:45:41,383 --> 00:45:45,566
Yet it never once lifts from the ground.

480
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:51,116
After grazing past a few small flowers, it struggles on before eventually coming to rest in the grass.

481
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:56,100
Lucien stops once more, his back-turned figure somewhat silent.

482
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:01,050
He keeps his head lowered, his thoughts unreadable to me; the ribbon dangling from the kite quietly brushes his sleeve.

483
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,283
I instinctively quicken my steps in his direction. Only when I draw near do I realize his gaze rests intently on the kite.

484
00:46:05,283 --> 00:46:10,266
His lowered lashes quiver faintly, as if in thought and as if listening to something.

485
00:46:10,266 --> 00:46:16,166
Lucien: Just now, I confirmed the real-time wind speed, wind force, and air humidity.

486
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:19,366
Lucien: But…

487
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:23,083
He lets out a soft sigh, brows furrowed as he murmurs.

488
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:33,116
Lucien: Although the current wind force is insufficient to lift the kite, theoretically, my running speed should be adequate…

489
00:46:33,116 --> 00:46:40,550
Lucien: Is the kite not light enough, or is its structure unstable?

490
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:46,316
As he speaks, his fingertips brush along the skeletal frame inch by inch. Lifting the kite slightly, he turns it toward the light to examine the paper surface closely.

491
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:52,750
Finally, he even takes out his phone's flashlight, shines it, and observes the kite's connection points with meticulous care, as if he is calibrating some precise laboratory apparatus.

492
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:58,516
I can't help but find him rather adorable, so I just stand quietly to the side, watching him study this 'flight apparatus'.

493
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:05,933
It turns out that this person really doesn't know how to fly a kite.

494
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:10,050
Lucien: MC, I know where the problem is.

495
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:14,700
I blink, waiting for him to go on.

496
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,516
Lucien: This kite has been stored away for too long.

497
00:47:19,516 --> 00:47:27,066
Lucien: Even if properly stored, the paper surface will still show minor dampening and instability in its balance.

498
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:36,300
Lucien: Perhaps while holding it, I can adjust the angle a bit, tilting it about 8 degrees to the left.

499
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,716
MC: ….

500
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:46,233
Lucien: Let's try again.

501
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:52,550
Before I can open my mouth to stop him, he's already tugging the string and starting to run, his arm raised high.

502
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:57,300
After being launched, the kite sways unsteadily, floats for just a moment, then falls back onto the grass.

503
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:03,916
The string in his hand drops down. Lucien merely glances back once, then turns and sprints off again in another direction.

504
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:10,933
MC: ...Such a stubborn fool.

505
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:16,633
I no longer stop him, just watch with a smile as he keeps repeating the same motions.

506
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:23,800
Again and again, over and over, like walking on a track he is unfamiliar with and not in the least skilled at.

507
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,216
Unwearied by the trouble and tedium, vexed yet full of anticipation.

508
00:48:29,216 --> 00:48:34,216
Until the fine sheen of sweat dampens his shirt, outlining his slender frame, and at last he stops.

509
00:48:34,216 --> 00:48:40,300
From afar, Lucien gazes toward me.

510
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:46,383
Even though I cannot see him clearly against the light, I still seem to hear his voice.

511
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:51,833
So I spread my arms wide toward him.

512
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:56,450
He walks toward me step by step, and finally even breaks into a run.

513
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:04,633
I move forward to meet him, embracing him tightly in my arms.

514
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:10,516
MC: Fool.

515
00:49:10,516 --> 00:49:16,483
Scent of rain-drenched grass wraps around me, welling in my eyes and seeping into my heart, moistening them both.²³

516
00:49:16,483 --> 00:49:22,266
The head resting atop mine gives a slight nod, as if in acknowledgment.

517
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:27,250
MC: Let's rest for a while.²⁴

518
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,816
A muffled reply falls. Lucien releases me and lies down on the grass.

519
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:41,483
The unwound kite string loosely encircles him, wrapping him into a colorful and tender embrace.

520
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:46,883
Soft strands of his hair are brushed aside by the breeze, revealing a pair of eyes uncharacteristically at a loss.

521
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:57,733
Perhaps even vast and intricate experimental data will not deter him; yet, at this moment, a kite trips up the genius's steps, causing him to inadvertently reveal a flicker of childlike vulnerability.

522
00:49:57,733 --> 00:50:04,000
He tilts his head up to look at me, gently closes his eyes for a moment, and lets out a sigh as if defeated.

523
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,600
Lucien: Teacher, I am a slow student.²⁵

524
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:15,200
Lucien: I can't even learn something this simple.

525
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,183
MC: Who says this is simple?

526
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:23,633
I refute him without hesitation, making those beautiful eyes widen momentarily.

527
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:28,116
I can't help but feel my heart soften. I crouch down over him, cup my chin, and look at him carefully.

528
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:30,750
MC: It's complicated.

529
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:35,383
MC: It needs patience, it requires skill, and it also needs the ability to observe and weigh things thoughtfully.

530
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:39,283
MC: It even requires just that little bit of extra luck.

531
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:45,433
A few flower stems cast faint, swaying shadows on his face, making him lower his lashes as if to escape.

532
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:51,333
The kite is loosely held in his hand, one corner drifting up lightly with the wind, then pulled down by him again, like a heart restlessly eager yet unwilling to yield.

533
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:57,016
I gently hold the kite string, which hangs down at his side, watching it wind and coil between us, like gazing down at a small river flowing through one another.

534
00:50:57,016 --> 00:51:04,300
MC: Bond and freedom are inherently contradictory. It’s difficult to strike a balance, isn’t it?²⁶

535
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,550
Wind on the ground billows the thin, light clothing. I look up toward the source of the 'small river', only to meet Lucien's thoughtful gaze directly.

536
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:17,650
Lucien: Yeah, it’s difficult.

537
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:24,666
Lucien: Seems like in moments like these, I'm always somewhat flustered and a little clumsy.

538
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:27,750
MC: Do you not want me to see?

539
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:31,866
Lucien: No, that's not it.

540
00:51:31,866 --> 00:51:37,366
Lucien: I'm glad you saw all of this.

541
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:47,966
Lucien: It’s just that I can’t help but wonder if the one pulling the thread was you… Then maybe this matter wouldn’t be so complicated.

542
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,516
His fingertips tap, seemingly inadvertently, on the spool handle before they tentatively reach toward me.

543
00:51:54,516 --> 00:51:58,533
He's talking about flying a kite, yet it's not just about flying a kite.

544
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:12,116
MC: But I can't do it alone.²⁷

545
00:52:12,116 --> 00:52:18,866
Smiling, I shake my head at him, leaving him stunned for a moment.

546
00:52:18,866 --> 00:52:25,100
MC: This is our promise; only when we fulfill it together does it hold meaning.

547
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,900
MC: Lucien, I can't do it alone.

548
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:35,416
MC: Just like love, this is a matter of two people.

549
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,150
Cicadas' cries drift from afar, and sunlight bathes the world, exposing its colors into richer, more variegated hues.

550
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:52,550
Lucien: MC, on one hand, I want to let you lead all of this, but on the other, I can't help wanting to do a lot alone.

551
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,333
Lucien: Is this also love?

552
00:52:56,333 --> 00:53:00,800
MC: Perhaps it is.

553
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:08,700
Lucien: Then I feel fortunate, so deeply fortunate, that the person standing before me at this moment is you.

554
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,816
Lucien: Is this also love?

555
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:17,900
MC: Perhaps it is, too.

556
00:53:21,066 --> 00:53:25,350
He blinks, his beautiful eyes suffused with a moist, glistening light. In that instant, the grass, trees, and flowers around him seemed to fade in color.²⁸

557
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:29,833
Letting me gladly and willingly drown in their depths.

558
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:34,783
Lucien: MC, please keep teaching me more.²⁹

559
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:42,966
Until that hazy warmth and loneliness gain clearer contours, until my cowardice always grows alongside my love.

560
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:49,266
Until I no longer need deduction or imitation, converging all this into love's own language.

561
00:53:49,266 --> 00:53:57,933
I can't resist lowering my head and kissing him.

562
00:53:57,933 --> 00:54:02,216
²²: 祂 (tā) is a special pronoun used mainly in religious or spiritual contexts to refer to God or divine being(s), distinguishing it from 他 (he), 她 (she), or 它 (it).

563
00:54:02,216 --> 00:54:11,183
I use They in English to carry that same sense of reverence while also leaving room for the possibility that the text is speaking of more than one god or divine presence, after all, he used it to refer to how the whole world came to help~

564
00:54:11,183 --> 00:54:25,866
²³: Random fun fact is that Lucien is often described with the scent of grass… so when the smell wraps around her, it's also a poetic way of saying he's embracing her. Yet it's also a wet scent that carries emotional weight of his endearing yet distressing stubbornness, seeping into her eyes and heart, making her tears rise and her heart ache.

565
00:54:25,866 --> 00:54:36,766
MC asks Lucien to rest instantly make me recalls last year’s summer SP (The Sea No Longer Far Away/Seaside At Last SP) As I mentioned in my previous Translation Notes and Insight, the Summer SP was where they learned to give each other the signal that it's okay to rest.

566
00:54:36,766 --> 00:54:46,383
But reaching that point took a journey: before then, Lucien literally tried to put into practice her metaphor of what it felt like to follow in his footsteps, doing something unfamiliar, failing over and over to the sea, and starting again, just to understand her feelings. 

567
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:52,700
That same stubborn fool is now facing another unfamiliar challenge, once again failing again and again and tirelessly starting over each time to fulfill their promise ;-;

568
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:58,883
And here, when Lucien looks at MC and she opens her arms wide, it mirrors the 7th Anniversary, except this time it's not her running into his arms… It's him running into hers, caught in her tight embrace.

569
00:54:58,883 --> 00:55:06,683
It's an act of finding and giving mutual solace, of complete acceptance, and of their growth as she also understands the importance of giving him the signal to rest. 

570
00:55:06,683 --> 00:55:13,666
This date is absolutely INSANE as the culmination of nearly eight years of their relationship growth.

571
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:22,316
²⁵: 笨学生 (bèn xué shēng) is often translated as 'stupid student', but in this context, it leans more to a humble 'I struggle to grasp this despite effort.' An idiomatic English equivalent for 笨学生 might be 'slow learner'. 

572
00:55:22,316 --> 00:55:30,516
However, I’ve chosen a slow student to retain the 'student' element, which preserves his deferential tone toward his 'teacher'. Other possible translations are foolish student or clumsy student, but neither foolish nor clumsy quite captures the meaning of 笨 here

573
00:55:30,516 --> 00:55:38,016
Lucien flying a kite without wind might be foolish, and his not smooth attempts might be clumsy, but what's being conveyed is his genuine struggle to learn despite his efforts.

574
00:55:38,016 --> 00:55:46,366
²⁶: I've translated this word into bond, but it might not capture the implicit restriction (hence the contradiction with freedom). The term 牵绊 (qiān bàn) is central to understanding this tension, as it refers to the emotional ties that bind people together, such as love, family, or deep friendship. 

575
00:55:46,366 --> 00:55:54,900
These bonds offer support, connection, and meaning, but they also imply being held back, obligated, or constrained. The character 牵 (qiān) means to pull or involve, while 绊 (bàn) means to trip or hinder. 

576
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:03,016
In the metaphor of flying a kite, the string is the 牵绊: it's what allows the kite to rise, guided and connected, but also what holds it back from complete freedom. Lucien lying down while being tenderly embraced by the kite string, and the string being held by MC like she's the one anchoring him to the world, making him stand on solid ground…

577
00:56:03,016 --> 00:56:12,383
I think the image beautifully encapsulates the essence of 牵绊. And indeed, balancing both 牵绊 (bond/tie) and ⾃由 (freedom) is never easy.

578
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:19,433
²⁷: The way they transform his infamous 'joking' line from chapter 13 where our Great Professor Lucien, with that aggrieved little expression, goes "I can't do it alone / won't be alright alone" when she said she wants to investigate by herself-

579
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:27,100
-into something so solemn here, of love as not something one should carry alone, but something to be fulfilled and shoulder together… LUCIEN WRITERS YOUR MIND!!!

580
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:34,583
The whole scene is such a masterstroke too! Lucien, who is still wrestling with the contradictory nature of love, is trying to make sense of it all. How he wants to let her lead, b/c a part of him believes maybe things wouldn't be so messy if only she bore the emotional reins, only for her to say that "I can't do it alone" b/c love isn’t a one-person task.

581
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:42,166
Then he wonders, if I still want to bear things alone sometimes, is that also love? And MC doesn't deny him, simply saying, "Perhaps it is." And that's when he says he feels fortunate, so deeply fortunate that the person standing before him is someone who understands him, his contradictions, his inner wars, and loves him as he is.

582
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:49,550
²⁸: In CN 眼眸覆上盈润的光 (lit. "eyes covered with moist light") often suggests eyes welling with unshed tears or an intense emotional sheen (tenderness, vulnerability, etc.). That raw radiance in his gaze is so vivid it seems to strip the surrounding world of its own colors 🥺

583
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:57,816
²⁹: "MC, please keep teaching me more." I think every XM stan knows just how precious these words are without me needing to overexplain. A genius, yet he's willing to be your most devoted, 'slow' student, stumbling and falling again and again in an effort to learn how to love you🥹 It's hard to not be touched...

584
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:07,883
The sky is seamless and blue, as if it has been washed clean, with a few wisps of cloud fluff floating by. Tender shoots of green grass brush the back of my neck and the rims of my ears, bringing a warm, ticklish sensation.

585
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,050
Sunlight spills down, blooming into a rainbow halo in my vision; I can't help but lazily lift a hand to shade my eyes.

586
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:17,533
Lucien and I lie head-to-head on the grass, the earth beneath us sending up faint tremors, as if enfolding us within the world's breathing.

587
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:23,650
Following my example, Lucien also stretches out his arm. His fingertips gently hook mine, and his low voice tickles in close, spilling out a trace of amusement.

588
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:29,516
Lucien: Is this now the second step of our kite-flying lesson?

589
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:35,116
MC: ...This student, please refrain from questioning your teacher.

590
00:57:35,116 --> 00:57:38,516
MC: Proper rest and adjustment are indeed an essential step in the learning process!

591
00:57:38,516 --> 00:57:43,350
Lucien: Hm, Teacher is right.

592
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:51,033
MC: [the way his expression suddenly turns cunning as she cluelessly says this LOL] But why is it the second step?

593
00:57:51,033 --> 00:57:56,616
Before the words have even left my lips, the man beside me rises and leans in, those long, narrow eyes glinting with triumph.

594
00:57:56,616 --> 00:58:01,816
The next moment, a warmth wrapped in the scent of fresh grass falls upon my lips.

595
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:07,450
His loosened bangs brush against my eyelids, lightly tickling, yet I can't bear to close them.

596
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:11,183
After pulling back slightly, I mutter with feigned sternness.

597
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:16,983
MC: Student, you're sneakily switching concepts!

598
00:58:16,983 --> 00:58:24,100
Lucien: Is that so? I thought it was called 'applying what I learned to master it'.

599
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,283
MC: Your eagerness to learn is really strong right now, isn't it.

600
00:58:28,283 --> 00:58:36,650
Lucien: After all, you've already taught me so much in this course. It's only right that I work harder.

601
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,733
He speaks frankly, and there's indeed an air of humble eagerness to learn in his demeanor.

602
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:46,350
I roll onto my side to face him, resting my head on my arm as I gaze at him earnestly.

603
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:50,933
Sunshine falls behind him, framing the kite he still cradles in his hands in a soft halo of light.

604
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:55,516
It clearly hasn't moved, but it seems as if it has already taken flight.

605
00:58:55,516 --> 00:59:00,983
I have imagined this very scene so many times and daydreamed about the us of now. It feels different, yet somehow not so different.

606
00:59:00,983 --> 00:59:06,916
I can't help reaching out to lay my hand over his chest, as if this simple act alone could touch that heart laid open to me.

607
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:10,716
MC: Do you know what we’re learning right now?

608
00:59:10,716 --> 00:59:14,533
Lucien shakes his head.

609
00:59:14,533 --> 00:59:20,816
MC: We're learning to get accustomed and to wait.

610
00:59:20,816 --> 00:59:26,566
He doesn't say a word, only looks at me deeply.

611
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:32,066
MC: When it started raining early this morning... I did feel a little disheartened. But strangely enough, I wasn't really surprised.

612
00:59:32,066 --> 00:59:37,683
MC: Perhaps it's because when it comes to flying a kite, all kinds of unexpected things always come with it, like a test left to us by fate.

613
00:59:37,683 --> 00:59:43,716
MC: Or perhaps it's that we both hope the day this promise is fulfilled will be special enough, so we never bring it up lightly.

614
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:53,600
MC: I wonder if we have bestowed far too much upon it, so much so that it grows heavier and heavier.

615
00:59:53,600 --> 01:00:01,083
MC: As time passes, I seem to have grown accustomed to its 'postponement', yet remain utterly certain it will arrive in the end, and so waiting has become second nature.

616
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:08,766
His gaze on me wavers ever so slightly, and I vaguely sense the pulsation beneath my fingertips unintentionally quicken.

617
01:00:08,766 --> 01:00:16,583
Lucien: Why didn't you bring this up before?

618
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:21,216
His voice is soft, yet it makes me fall briefly silent.

619
01:00:21,216 --> 01:00:26,750
Yeah. Why didn't I take the initiative to bring this up before?

620
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:39,566
It was clearly a promise belonging to both of us. Clearly, either of us could have taken the first step.

621
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:45,400
Maybe it is because it's too special.

622
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:53,100
In that stretch of bittersweet memory, I don't know whether I should solemnly take it up or naturally hold it tight just then.

623
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,466
Should my tone be calm and even, or should I reveal an expression of wholehearted joy?

624
01:00:57,466 --> 01:01:02,900
So whenever I think of this matter, I always feel a bit hesitant. It's because it is too deeply treasured that it's approached so cautiously.

625
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,933
And so, just like that, year after year, it follows us forward, watching us change and grow.

626
01:01:07,933 --> 01:01:15,250
Like a shadow that accompanies us, it becomes part of us.

627
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:23,350
Even now, I find no fitting reason to explain it.

628
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:29,700
Lucien: Because I used to be afraid.³⁰

629
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:35,283
Lucien suddenly speaks, answering the very question he asked me.

630
01:01:35,283 --> 01:01:40,666
He lifts his hand and catches my fingertips, gently tightening his hold.

631
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:51,616
Lucien: When I'm far away from you, the deeper my love for you grows. The closer I am to you, the more I feel I'm still not enough.³¹

632
01:01:51,616 --> 01:01:58,033
Lucien: Not honest enough, not courageous enough…

633
01:01:58,033 --> 01:02:04,883
Lucien: Not real enough.

634
01:02:04,883 --> 01:02:08,366
He says while raising that kite.

635
01:02:08,366 --> 01:02:14,750
The snow-white paper surface is now stained with a slight muddiness; the pink ribbons bound to it flutter as if whispering something.

636
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:21,433
When I saw it placed with care in the entryway before we left, I knew then that this was not a hastily prepared kite.

637
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:26,300
Yet I had absolutely no idea when it had already been in our home.

638
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:33,033
As if he has seen through my heart, Lucien's gaze also falls toward the kite.

639
01:02:33,033 --> 01:02:45,366
Lucien: I probably prepared it a long time ago and recorded many moments.

640
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:59,766
Lucien: Every time I felt I was one step closer to completing this, I would tie a knot on this kite.³²

641
01:02:59,766 --> 01:03:05,783
As he speaks, the ribbons happen to flutter up, their refracted colors streaming into my eyes, making them grow slightly warm.

642
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:14,450
Lucien: They are both my honesty and courage, and also my hesitation and wavering.

643
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:27,266
Lucien: It's like an unsolved equation. Before a new answer emerges, it reappears time and again, compelling me to explore it over and over.

644
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:34,700
Lucien: It makes me confront it all the time and reflect on it again and again.

645
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:40,566
Lucien: But MC, I've never forgotten this promise.

646
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:44,016
His eyes unhurriedly settle back on me.

647
01:03:44,016 --> 01:03:52,316
Lucien: In fact, there were many moments in the past when I would often think of it.

648
01:03:52,316 --> 01:03:59,400
Lucien: And whenever I think of it, I distinctly feel a kind of change.

649
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:07,250
Lucien: One that feels like roots taking hold and buds sprouting.

650
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:19,283
Lucien: It spreads bit by bit, until it fills my entire heart, until it bursts forth in vigorous growth.³³

651
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:28,200
My fingertips, guided by him, wander across his chest, as if sketching the scene he described.

652
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:34,000
Scorching pulses pass through his skin into mine, and my heart resonates in response.

653
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:41,366
For the moment, I don’t know what to say; I can only try hard to slow my breathing, afraid that the scene before my eyes will become blurry in the blink of an eye.

654
01:04:41,366 --> 01:04:55,350
Lucien: This feeling makes me happy and satisfied, yet I greedily want to keep it all to myself.

655
01:04:55,350 --> 01:05:06,083
Lucien: So it turns out I'm this much of a cowardly and selfish person.

656
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:12,150
The world becomes a hazy wash of brilliant colors. I lean in, eyes shut, and press a kiss against his eyes.

657
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:16,066
MC: Fool.

658
01:05:16,066 --> 01:05:22,933
MC: You've already come to be completely certain that, no matter how cruelly you dissect yourself, I can accept all of it.³⁴

659
01:05:22,933 --> 01:05:28,000
MC: How can you still call yourself cowardly when you're so certain and confident?

660
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:35,550
MC: Obviously it's me who doesn't know what to do with you.

661
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:43,166
Lucien: Then just always worry about me.³⁵

662
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:55,983
Lucien: Before you teach me more, I hope I can become the subject you will forever study and explore.

663
01:05:55,983 --> 01:06:01,883
The soft pads of his fingers brush affectionately past the corner of my eye, then cradle my face with utmost care.

664
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:12,116
At this very moment, my heart and eyes are wholly filled with him. In his gaze, I can distinctly see my complete self, the vast sky, and the swaying flowers, grasses, and trees.

665
01:06:12,116 --> 01:06:24,350
I suddenly realize something and immediately pull Lucien to a sitting position.

666
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:28,350
MC: Lucien—

667
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:32,533
Lucien: The wind is rising.³⁶

668
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:37,033
We run on the grass like two children, holding onto the string, tugging and pulling it together—

669
01:06:37,033 --> 01:06:41,550
The kite finally soars into the sky.

670
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:47,016
It rides the wind, passing through my countless imaginings and anticipations, glides past light and shadow, and comes to rest in the azure sky.

671
01:06:47,016 --> 01:06:52,366
Its edges are both vague and clear. It appears so simple, yet also seems so surreal.

672
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:57,950
I feel as if I’m also being gently lifted, like that tiny kite, but I can only see with blurry vision.

673
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:04,966
When the kite flies up into the sky, Lucien feels that he has seen such a scene before.

674
01:07:04,966 --> 01:07:09,316
Through the long years after the promise was sealed with a pinky swear, he has seen it in his dreams.

675
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:15,716
But the teardrop that slips unbidden from the corner of the girl's eye, rolling onto his fingertips as she smiles, is something he has never seen in those dreams.

676
01:07:15,716 --> 01:07:21,566
Scalding and profoundly heavy, it seeps its way into his heart, filling him with a sense of fulfilled wholeness and making him feel at peace.

677
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:26,950
Lucien: ...Don't cry.

678
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:30,950
His warm fingertip brushes over my eyes, letting them trace his outline again and again.

679
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:37,750
Lucien: MC, the weather is very good today— even if it isn't spring, it's still very good.

680
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:43,666
Lucien: And I... have walked step by step until I arrived before you.

681
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:48,916
Lucien: Our kite has flown up.

682
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:56,816
It is as if he, too, is now struggling for words, no longer able to find any phrasing that can fully articulate or thoroughly explain this distant and drawn-out road.

683
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,850
So he can only tighten his arms. His kiss replaces his fingertips, replaces words, replaces everything.

684
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,750
This kiss is far too tender and reverent. I close my eyes, yet it’s as if I see his countless countenances.

685
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:10,600
Gentle, indifferent, sad, aggrieved, smiling… until at last, they all merge into the face of the person before me.

686
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:16,533
Just like his kiss, obviously so endearingly moving, yet in the moment of my instinctual retreat, it assertively pulls me back to his side.³⁷

687
01:08:16,533 --> 01:08:20,400
I’m deeply entangled in him—no longer able to escape, unable to leave.

688
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,333
I open my eyes and fall into those serene, profound pupils, seeing all the solemn sincerity and love within them.

689
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,500
MC: I…..

690
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,533
Lucien: I love you, MC.

691
01:08:28,533 --> 01:08:30,616
Lucien: I love you.

692
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:35,950
He draws closer to me; there is no longer any hesitation or doubt in him.

693
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:43,883
Lucien: Even if I still haven't understood the full meaning of love, even if I am such a slow student of yours.

694
01:08:43,883 --> 01:08:51,916
Lucien: But in this moment, I know… I love you.

695
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:56,016
He repeats tirelessly, yet each utterance is so different.

696
01:08:56,016 --> 01:09:00,850
Love is such a simple and yet complex feeling. At this moment, I realize it cannot be assisted or replaced by any words.

697
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:06,216
Whenever it is mentioned, I can see Lucien and myself on this long, long road.

698
01:09:06,216 --> 01:09:09,850
MC: Then do you know my answer?

699
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,916
Lucien: I know.

700
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:18,800
Lucien: Because... I've felt love.

701
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:25,450
He gently lifts the corners of his mouth and simply gazes at me quietly, as if gazing upward in reverence.

702
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:31,033
I cup his face in my hands, trying to see him more clearly.

703
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:35,883
MC: Lucien, I love you.

704
01:09:35,883 --> 01:09:47,666
We don't let such beautiful and gentle weather go to waste.

705
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:56,150
It’s just perfect how the kite string loops around the ring finger of his left hand once their promise is finally fulfilled... because that's exactly where a wedding ring is traditionally worn by the groom;-; 

706
01:09:56,150 --> 01:10:05,333
Coincidental, as if the world itself is acknowledging his commitment; with MC is the one holding the string, the one tethering him, grounding him, but also letting him fly—she becomes both his restraint and his freedom.

707
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:15,666
³⁰: Remember what I said in the date guide about the 7th anniversary being full of Chekhov's guns? Here's another one firing! In the 7th anniversary story, Lucien teasingly asks the MC if she wants to hear him say "I'm afraid" (害怕 / hàipà), and she shoots back, asking if there was anything else he didn't dare do.

708
01:10:15,666 --> 01:10:27,716
Now he finally says it in earnest: "因为我曾经害怕" (Yīnwèi wǒ céngjīng hàipà / "Because I used to be afraid"). And some of those fears, the things he never dared to do before… this whole story becomes his answer ;-;

709
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:37,400
³¹: When he's far from you, the deeper his love for you grows; yet when he draws close, he's afraid he's not enough to show just how deeply he loves you. It’s not that his love is not enough or falls short, but that he doubts his own ability to love and even himself. Afraid that he's not honest enough, not brave enough, not… real enough.

710
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:48,566
That last line with its use of 真实 (zhēn shí, genuine, not fake (authentic), and also factually consistent with reality (real/existing)) is striking because on one level it’s a callback to the 7th anniversary when he confessed that she’s what makes him real and be his authentic self, allowing him to continue 'existing'.

711
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:53,966
But it can also be read as him breaking the fourth wall, feeling afraid that he's not real enough for us.

712
01:10:53,966 --> 01:11:01,833
³²: This is our eighth year together, and if you see the full art of the pre-evolve CG, there are exactly eight ribbons tied to the kite in the CG… Has it really been here all this time, ever since he made that promise? Even after everything that happened at chapter 13, did he still choose to immediately buy it, holding on to the hope that they’ll really fly one someday?

713
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:10,150
 I can’t help but wonder, when Lucien bought the new kite again in Season 2, did he quietly add the ribbons from his Season 1 memories after getting his memories back? Turns out this kite has been silently accompanying them through all the years, bearing witness as their love quietly grew for eight long years….

714
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:18,966
Perhaps buying a kite is easy; what's difficult is finding the courage to fulfill that promise, the courage to choose to love someone even when you know it won't be perfect or 'fitting', when love is complicated and can be nearly impossible to express in its entirety. 

715
01:11:18,966 --> 01:11:27,366
 Maybe that’s why the old kite itself is so precious. Each ribbon marks a step in his long, hesitant journey toward being ready and certain to love; it records and treasures the messy process, showing that it’s precisely this imperfect, human becoming that makes love real.

716
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:34,300
³³: Lucien and MC's narrative progression with the plant-growth metaphor is honestly a stroke of genius🥹—

717
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:41,166
what begins as a seed (the heart-throbbing/infatuation, bringing instinctive joy and happiness, fulfill their desires)

718
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:48,050
gradually grows and bears flowers (love itself, something more profound and more enduring than fleeting happiness or a fluttering heart, 

719
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:54,916
where the beloved’s happiness becomes more important than satisfying one's own desires), 

720
01:11:54,916 --> 01:12:01,500
 and from there, love also gives rise to other human emotions intertwined with it (pain, fear, greed, hesitation, but also satisfaction, courage, persistence and tenderness) ultimately taking root and sprouting buds (signifying both vitality and anchoring, something that continually renews itself and turn their bond to be a lifelong one).

721
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:08,983
So love for them isn't just something fleeting, but about love evolving through stages, becoming more complex, fertile, and enduring over time.

722
01:12:08,983 --> 01:12:17,016
Also! The recurring theme of words is inadequate when it comes to expressing the depths of love. Instead, feelings are conveyed through the body, through touch, through heartbeat.

723
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:25,233
For someone who usually relies on intellect and speech, Lucien's choice to abandon words and let his heart speak reveals both vulnerability, growth, and the rawness of his emotions. It shows his recognition that the heart can express truth more honestly than any rhetoric ever could.

724
01:12:25,233 --> 01:12:36,450
³⁴: 你已经完全确认,无论你对自己进行多么残忍的剖析,我都能接受了 (You’ve already come to be completely certain/fully confirmed that, no matter how cruelly you dissect yourself, I can accept all of it.) is an echo of the 7th Anniversary, where he does become certain that no matter how ruthlessly he analyzes himself, or what choices he makes,

725
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:47,550
she will always choose to walk toward him and embrace everything that he is. She isn’t trying to fix him, nor is she afraid of the darker or more complicated parts of who he is. Instead, she shows a mature, steady kind of love—the kind that fully sees someone, flaws and all, and stays anyway.

726
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:56,183
³⁵: I translated it as worry, but in a romantic context, 烦恼 (fán nǎo) implies a deeper, more persistent state of thoughtful preoccupation and tender concern. It's not the usual "I'm scared something bad will happen" kind of worry (that would be 担心 dān xīn) 

727
01:12:56,183 --> 01:13:04,000
 as it’s more of a kind of soft, constant emotional entanglement where someone lives in your head and in your heart rent-free. That line as a whole is a vulnerable and slightly possessive confession, like he's asking her to never stop caring, overthinking, loving, and being tenderly troubled by him and his complexities.

728
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,250
³⁶: 起风了 (The wind is rising) is the same line from their VERY FIRST date, firefly date. The contrast in how Lucien feels each time he says it, as well as the progression of their relationship, is just so ༼;´༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ༽. 

729
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:13,233
The repetition of 'The wind is rising' bridges the beginning of their story to this moment, showing just how far Lucien has grown through his connection with her.

730
01:13:13,233 --> 01:13:21,483
 In the Firefly date, he uses the line to reference the French poem "The Graveyard by the Sea" by Paul Valéry. Back then, seeing the weak fireflies made him think they won’t live long because survival of the fittest is all he’s ever known. 

731
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:28,200
But earlier in this MQ, when he sees the fireflies glowing around them, he doesn’t see survival – he sees wonder, through her smile and joy, through the fireflies' glow in her eyes. 

732
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:35,733
From once viewing the world through a detached, almost fatalistic lens, to now holding onto beauty and learning how to cherish it, he’s no longer just surviving and observing life. He's living it. Because of her. Because of love.

733
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:46,983
³⁷: 惹人爱怜 (rě rén ài lián, lit - 'causes people to feel pity and love/affection’). It describes someone/something so endearing that you can't help but want to love and protect them. I like how this phrase is used in this context; it highlights the tender, vulnerable quality of his kiss while contrasting with the firm assertiveness that keeps her from retreating. 

734
01:13:46,983 --> 01:13:51,933
It also reminds me of his prison AU number 0525 (ling wǔ èr wǔ), which can be read as "怜我爱我" (lián wǒ ài wǒ), literally meaning 'pity me, love me'.

735
01:13:51,933 --> 01:13:59,933
Seven years is a long time. Long enough that I started to wonder if maybe they'd never fly that kite. That perhaps it was something meant to stay unfinished until they reach their happy ending at the end of the game. But looking back now, I think it was just a matter of waiting for spring to arrive. 

736
01:13:59,933 --> 01:14:13,766
Just like he once said back in Season 2 Chapter 13, "Spring isn't necessarily just a fixed time.", maybe it's not spring as in the season but the spring in his heart. It took him years to reach this point. Through the 7th anniversary, when he revealed the black-and-white world and the colors she brought to it, when he confessed how love had brought him fear and courage, 

737
01:14:13,766 --> 01:14:26,733
pain and comfort, and ultimately, a sense of being real. Through Because of Love, when he finally let go of hesitation and bared his entire heart without any reservation. Only after all of that could the kite finally rise.

738
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:39,866
And maybe it's perfect that it happens in summer, because it's a season full of rainy days, where on some days they have to chase after the miracle of a 20% chance of sunshine, just like the kite, something they'd been trying to fly for years, always held back by timing, circumstance, and its heavy meaning.

739
01:14:39,866 --> 01:14:48,000
It emphasizes the struggle and the long road they took to finally make it fly, making the moment it soars feel like something far more than a simple scene. It's the culmination of everything he had endured: his insecurity, his fear, his yearning, his pain.

740
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:53,700
He had to walk a long and difficult path before he could finally stand before her with frankness, look into her eyes, and say, "I love you. My heart chooses to love you." (Because of Love after-evolve karma's line)

741
01:14:53,700 --> 01:15:05,450
Of course, even after he found the courage to ask her to fly one, actually flying the kite wasn't easy. He kept running back and forth, as if sheer effort could replace the missing wind. She called out directions, and he followed, but you could still see that he was trying to shoulder everything by himself, continually adjusting the kite experimentally. 

742
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:19,533
Watching this genius fumble so earnestly, my tears wouldn't stop. Such a fool, unwilling to give up, reluctant to lean on anyone. It wasn't until she signaled him to rest that he lay back in the grass, the string falling loosely around him like a soft embrace, and whispered, "Teacher, I am a slow student." And that was the moment he turned to her. 

743
01:15:19,533 --> 01:15:32,100
Not just about the kite, but about the two of them. Admitting his vulnerability, letting her in, allowing himself to be guided… because only when you show all of yourself can you be thoroughly cherished and loved, right? And she answered with the same sentence he said years ago: "But I can't do it alone."

744
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:44,600
And that's it, isn't it? Love isn't a solo endeavor. Neither is fulfilling a promise to fly a kite. Honestly, the kite is such a brilliant metaphor for love itself: it needs effort, patience, timing, a little luck, and the delicate balance between restraint and freedom.

745
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:51,266
And one of the things I love most about XMMC's love is that it's a bond built from nothing, where looking back, you can trace every step as they grow together. Maybe the yearning was light at first, just curiosity toward someone who could have remained a stranger. 

746
01:15:51,266 --> 01:15:59,266
But over the years, it grew heavier because their bond was something they had to choose and rebuild again and again, despite fear, hesitation, and obstacles. Their whole story is a reminder of how fragile and miraculous love can be. 

747
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:11,850
Luck gave them the chance to meet, but it was their choices that kept it alive. The yearning never ends because every moment of happiness carries the awareness that it all could have slipped away, and the only way to honor that miracle is to hold on tightly and protect it with everything you are.

748
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:17,266
Once they opened their hearts to each other again and stopped hiding, revealing the reason why it took so long to fulfill this promise, the wind began to blow.

749
01:16:17,266 --> 01:16:23,833
The kite soared as they held the string together. Beneath it, he said "Don't cry" with such gentleness (which actually makes me cry even harder ༼;' ༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ༽), kissing again and again, repeatedly whispering "I love you" under the sky we all had waited years for. 

750
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:33,416
Because in the end, there were no other words that could capture this long, arduous journey better than love. That day wasn't just a sunny day. It was a day filled with all the love they had fought so hard to understand. 

751
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:39,383
Seven years of waiting. Seven years of growth. And finally, this promise was fulfilled.

752
01:16:39,383 --> 01:16:50,050
From kites to fireflies, from red ribbons to red threads and even kite threads, from luck and miracles to love that's like a seed—love that makes people greedy, love that makes people afraid—so many things about this date instantly make me think of the long road we’ve walked together. 

753
01:16:50,050 --> 01:17:00,250
 I could go on forever, but I'll stop here. If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading. This story means the world to me, and I can't put into words how much it means to finally see this moment come true after everything.

754
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:07,416
Lucien, happy inner spring. Our kite has flown 🪁
